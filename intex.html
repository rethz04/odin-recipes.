               <Ii>Take the juice from one bottle of O1' Janx Spirit.</Ii>
               <Ii>Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V -oh that Santraginus seawater! oh, those 
               Santraginus fist!</Ii>
               <Ii>Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzene is lost).</Ii>
               <Ii>Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of all those happy hikers who have died of
            pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia.</IiL>
            <Ii>
					 Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the
            dark Qualactin Zones, subtle, sweet and mystic.</Ii>
            <Ii>Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the
            heart of the drink.</Ii>
